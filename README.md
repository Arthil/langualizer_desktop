# Langualizer

Langualizer is a language teaching software, which helps you memorize and learn words in different languages. Langualizer gives the user full flexibility to add custom words to give the ability to learn exactly the words that need to be learned. After a vocabulary has been added, the user can make quizes or exams to train the added words.
